			<h1>Backstage</h1>
			<p>Go behind the scenes and find out more about one of our most iconic pieces. You’ll find exclusive insights into the creation of this show. If you’re an avid fan with an insatiable curiosity become a fly on the wall and explore what makes our production so different.</p>

			<h1>Green Room</h1>
			<p>The stage is pitch black as the dramatic opening bars of Tchaikovsky's score are heard. As the music grows more sinister the stage lights reveal a giant bed with a royal crest on the headboard. Tossing and turning in the bed, in the grip of an apparent nightmare, is a young Prince. Above him, the subject of his sleep terror is disclosed – a male swan flapping feverishly; dark, menacing and wild. </p>

			<h1>Costume Design</h1>
			<p>Olivier award-winning set and costume designer, Lez Brotherston: We spoke about this idea that if they are to be men dancing the role of the Swans then male swans are actually quite aggressive and vicious; and they’re strong. So actually, covering up the body seemed pointless. We wanted to see muscles, we wanted to see body work and we wanted to see as much as we could.</p>

			<h1>Flats in Set Design</h1>
			<p>A flat is a lightweight timber frame covered with scenic canvas, or plywood. Flats are used to provide a lightweight and easy to move and re-configure backdrop to a stage set. Flats sometimes have windows or doors built into them to provide extra flexibility, for use in realistic settings.</p>

			<h1>Company Maneger</h1>
			<p>The Prince jolts awake and his mother, the Queen, enters his room. As she briefly checks his forehead for signs of a temperature, the Prince reaches for her, but the Queen makes it very clear her son should keep his distance and exists swiftly. The lights fade on a dejected-looking Prince. </p>

			<h1>Liam Mower in Studio Rehearsal</h1>
			<p>Liam Mower plays the Prince. With an enthusiastic but desperately unsuitable girlfriend and a broken relationship with his mother, the Prince is tormented by the realities of his life as the son of a monarch. When he meets the Swan in Act Two this unexpected encounter signifies the beginning of change. </p>

			<h1>Marks on the Stage</h1>
			<p>There were elements of the original show, like the ‘Soho scene’, that I thought were dated – not only in terms of the physical ‘things’, but actually in terms of ideas too. ‘Soho’ was done originally on very, very little money and those costumes, and those decisions, still stood 20 years later. So, it was very nice to meet with Matthew and look at it again.</p>

			<h1>Wardrobe</h1>
			<p>Within the parameters of what we’re trying to achieve of course there is inclusion and there is ‘working together’, but it’s my job to remember what the other 30 people are wearing at the same time too; and so there might be a reason why you can’t have the colour you might like (because it has to work as an ensemble). </p>

			<h1>Stage Manager with Cast</h1>
			<p>It’s always good to work with dancers, but not in the first stages of creating the characters, because they don’t have the overall view of the show at that stage and don’t know how they fit in relation to the other characters, and what the ‘pecking-order’ is of the other characters, for example. But, once I’ve got them in the room and I’m putting them into the costumes that I have designed for their character with them in mind, of course I’m having a dialogue with them about ‘can you cope with that skirt length?’, ‘do you think we should go a bit tighter on the sleeve?’etc.</p>

			<h1>Pianist in Rehearsal</h1>
			<p>Ultimately it has to be filtered through one person in the end, because designing ‘by committee’ doesn’t work. And also, for example, costumes being designed by the people who are going to be wearing them can never work, because they can never divorce themselves from the character enough to know whether it works for the character, or not.</p>

			<h1>Dominic North and Max Westwell in Studio Rehearsal</h1>
			<p>Etta Murfitt, Associate Artistic Director: It is quite massive because we do have 40 dancers, and each dancer has to learn mainly two roles. Some of them are having to learn three, people who have done it before, and so that means you've got people having to learn two roles.</p>

			<h1>Wardrobe</h1>
			<p>Apart from once, the Swan costumes, have always been made by Phil Reynolds. He has literally made hundreds and hundreds of those Swan legs over the years and is like a production line when he gets going! He contributed to the way we made them. We spoke about them, we prototyped them, and they’re as much ‘his’ as they are ‘mine’. The V&A have got a pair and also a couple other museums; and endless Swans have stolen them! </p>

			<h1>Wigs</h1>
			<p>We made prototypes in many different kinds of fabrics, but the chiffon is the most ‘friendly’. When you first make them they’re very fluffy and then when you wash them a few times the silk chiffon starts to twist and ‘dread-up’ a bit and they go like dreadlocks, which is nice and I like them best when they’re about 3-4 weeks into the run because they’ve ‘collapsed’ a bit but they still move well.</p>

			<h1>Lighting</h1>
			<p>It is very simple in a way – the palace world is very austere and clear. In terms of character, the emotional state of the space is less reflected in the lighting. For example, if the characters on stage start getting angry, the lighting state doesn’t change to red. The use of both clear and white states, are very much the ‘the muscle’ behind the show. </p>
