			<p>Apart from once, the Swan costumes, have always been made by Phil Reynolds. He has literally made hundreds and hundreds of those Swan legs over the years and is like a production line when he gets going! He contributed to the way we made them. We spoke about them, we prototyped them, and they’re as much ‘his’ as they are ‘mine’. The V&A have got a pair and also a couple other museums; and endless Swans have stolen them! </p>
